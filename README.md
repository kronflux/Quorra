# Quorra
A script designed to automate computer setups

This script is intended to remove OEM junk software that comes with new computers. It is also intended to assist in malware/junkware removals and tune-ups.

Quorra was originally designed to be run in a very specific environment and structure, however over the next little while I hope to make Quorra useful to everyone under any environment.

As of right now, the correct folder structure is as follows:
\\share\afk\scripts\Quorra.bat
\\share\afk\scripts\resources\

In time, it will hopefully be completely portable and useful in any share, locally or on removable media.
