# Quorra
A script designed to automate new computer setups

This script is intended to remove OEM junk software that comes with new computers. It is also intended to assist in malware/junkware removals and tune-ups.

Quorra was originally designed to be run in a very specific environment and structure, however over the next little while I hope to make Quorra useful to everyone under any environment.

As of right now, the correct folder structure is as follows:

\\\techpc\share\scripts\Quorra.bat

\\\techpc\share\scripts\resources\

Any executable files(exe) will be dummy placeholders, open the files in a text editor for the URL's to download the proper executables in their place.

In time, it will hopefully be completely portable and useful in any share, locally or on removable media.

I would like to take the time to point out that many of the entries this script is designed to remove are directly ported from the Tron project (https://github.com/bmrf/tron).

Quorra is a spiritual sister script to Tron.
